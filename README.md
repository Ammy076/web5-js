In the above code, replace 'https://your-server.com/initiate-payment' with the actual URL of your server endpoint that handles payment initiation. The transactionData parameter should be an object containing the necessary data for the transaction, such as the merchant ID, transaction ID, user ID, amount, redirect URLs, mobile number, and payment instrument details.

Handle Responses: After sending the request, you should handle the response appropriately. For instance, if the payment was successful, you might update the UI to reflect this. If the payment failed, you might show an error message.
